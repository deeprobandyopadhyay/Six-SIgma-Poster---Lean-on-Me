## 📚 Term Bank & Key Formulas

### Core Concepts

#### **Inventory Turnover (IT) Rate**
**Definition:** The number of times inventory is sold and replaced over a period. Higher turnover indicates efficient inventory management.

**Formula:**
```
IT = Total Units Sold / Average Inventory Level
```

**Example:**
- Total units sold in 6 months: 3,923 units
- Average inventory held: 1,500 units
- IT = 3,923 / 1,500 = 2.62 (Baseline)

**Why It Matters for Our Project:**
- Our baseline IT of 2.62 means inventory sits for an average of 139 days before being sold
- Target IT of 4.00 reduces holding period to 91 days (34.5% improvement)
- Higher IT directly reduces carrying costs by 34.5% (₱6,030 annual savings)
- Improves cash flow and capital efficiency

---

#### **Weighted Moving Average (WMA) Forecasting**
**Definition:** A forecasting method that assigns higher weights to more recent data points, making it responsive to demand changes while smoothing out noise.

**Formula:**
```
WMA_t = (w₁ × D_{t-1}) + (w₂ × D_{t-2}) + (w₃ × D_{t-3})

Where:
- t = current time period
- D = actual demand (units sold)
- w = weight assigned to each period (sum = 1.0)
```

**Our Project's Weighting Scheme:**
```
WMA = (0.60 × D_recent) + (0.30 × D_previous) + (0.10 × D_two_months_ago)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Month -1 (most recent): 670 units sold
- Month -2 (previous): 660 units sold
- Month -3 (two months ago): 650 units sold

```
WMA = (0.60 × 670) + (0.30 × 660) + (0.10 × 650)
WMA = 402 + 198 + 65
WMA = 665 units (forecasted demand for next month)
```

**Why It Matters for Our Project:**
- Captures recent demand trends (60% weight) while maintaining stability
- 5% more responsive than simple moving average for retail environments
- Enables predictive procurement instead of reactive ordering
- Reduces both overstocking (excess costs) and understocking (lost sales)
- Root cause analysis showed "no forecasting system" was primary problem—WMA solves this
- Generates ₱6,030 annual savings through better inventory alignment

---

#### **Inventory Turnover Optimization (ITO) Framework**
**Definition:** A systematic approach that links demand forecasts to inventory targets, ensuring procurement decisions maintain a specific efficiency goal (IT rate).

**Formula:**
```
Target Average Inventory = WMA Forecasted Demand / Target IT Rate

Reorder Point = Target Average Inventory - Current Inventory Level

Optimal Order Quantity = Reorder Point + Safety Stock
```

**Example in Our Project:**
```
Step 1: Forecast demand using WMA
WMA_forecast = 665 units/month

Step 2: Calculate target inventory
Target_Inventory = 665 / 4.00 = 166.25 units

Step 3: Set reorder point
Current_Inventory = 150 units
Reorder Point = 166.25 - 150 = 16.25 units

Step 4: Place order when inventory drops to reorder point
→ Maintains IT = 4.00 automatically
```

**Why It Matters for Our Project:**
- **Automatable:** Every reorder decision follows the same logic (formula-based, not guesswork)
- **Aligned to Target:** Ensures all procurement decisions drive toward IT = 4.00 goal
- **Capital Efficient:** Reduces average inventory from ₱87,389 to ₱57,240 (₱30,149 released)
- **Eliminates Variation:** Reduces process variation by 52.7%
- **Scalable:** Same framework works across all 21 stores and 121 SKUs
- **Six Sigma Principle:** Achieves efficiency gains through process improvement, not resource addition

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| KPI | Formula | Baseline | Target | Status |
|-----|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Inventory Turnover Rate** | Total Sold / Avg Inventory | 2.62 | 4.00 | ⚠️ In Progress |
| **Holding Period (Days)** | 365 / IT Rate | 139 | 91 | ⚠️ In Progress |
| **Annual Holding Cost** | (Avg Inventory × Annual COGS Rate) × 0.20 | ₱17,478 | ₱11,448 | ⚠️ In Progress |
| **Sales Growth Rate** | (Forecast - Actual) / Actual | — | +5% | ✅ Projected |
| **Gross Profit Margin** | (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue | 66.67% | 66.67% | ✅ Maintained |
| **Capital Efficiency** | Current Inventory - Target Inventory | — | ₱30,149 | ✅ Achieved |

### Statistical Validation Terms

**Bootstrap Simulation:** A resampling technique used to estimate confidence intervals. We used n=10,000 simulations to validate our results with 95% confidence.

**95% Confidence Interval:** The range where we're 95% confident the true value lies. Example: Annual savings of ₱6,030 with CI [₱4,258, ₱7,802] means we're 95% confident the true savings falls within this range.

**Five Whys Analysis:** A root cause investigation technique asking "Why?" five times to identify the fundamental cause rather than symptoms.

**Fault Tree Analysis:** A hierarchical diagram showing how multiple failures cascade upward to create business risk.

---
## 📈 Methodology

### Weighted Moving Average (WMA)

The forecasting model uses a responsive 3-month weighted average:

```
WMA_t = (0.6 × D_{t-1}) + (0.3 × D_{t-2}) + (0.1 × D_{t-3})
```

Where **D** = monthly demand (units sold)

**Why WMA?** More responsive to recent demand changes than simple moving average, ideal for retail inventory management.

### Inventory Turnover Optimization (ITO)

Links WMA forecasts to efficiency targets:

```
Target Avg Inventory = WMA Sales / 4.00
Reorder Point = Target - Current Inventory
```

**Target IT = 4.00** reduces holding period from 139 to 91 days (34.5% improvement).

### Six Sigma DMAIC Integration

| Phase | Our Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Define** | IT Rate = 2.62, Holding Period = 139 days |
| **Measure** | 6 months data: 150 observations, 5 stores |
| **Analyze** | 5 Whys + Fault Tree → Root cause: No forecasting |
| **Improve** | WMA + ITO implementation with interactive dashboard |
| **Control** | 95% CI validation, bootstrap (n=10,000) simulations |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

### Adjust WMA Weights

Modify the `compute_wma()` function call in the server to change forecasting sensitivity:

```r
# Default: 60% recent, 30% previous, 10% two months back
wma <- compute_wma(df, weights = c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1))

# More responsive (80% recent):
wma <- compute_wma(df, weights = c(0.8, 0.15, 0.05))
```

### Change Target IT Rate

Update the target inventory turnover throughout the app:

```r
# Search for "4.00" and replace with your target (e.g., "3.50")
# Affects: QoI calculations, visuals, simulator results
```

### Adjust Bootstrap Simulations

For faster processing or higher precision:

```r
# In compute_confidence_intervals(), modify n_bootstrap
n_bootstrap <- 5000    # Faster, less precise
n_bootstrap <- 25000   # Slower, more precise
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** "Error loading data: Column names don't match"
- **Solution:** Verify CSV has exactly these columns (case-sensitive):
  - Store, Item Name, Month, Number Stored in Inventory, Number Sold, Cost (PHP), Revenue (PHP)

**Problem:** "No valid turnover data available"
- **Solution:** Check that "Number Stored in Inventory" > 0 for all rows

**Problem:** Dashboard loads but charts don't appear
- **Solution:** Clear browser cache or restart R session. Ensure all packages are installed.

**Problem:** AI Assistant returns generic response
- **Solution:** Try more specific questions like "current IT rate" or "WMA forecast"
